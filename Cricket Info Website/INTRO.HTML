<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=BROWN FACE=''COMIC SAN MS''>
History does not mean the dramatic events of the world.It also reveals how
things have changed.Everything around us has a history.All things have evolved
and consequently we have come to the present,mordenized and technically
advanced world.Even the games we play have changed over time.The cricket
played in a village of England has grown into a game played in giant stadiums.News
of cricket today hits the headlines of newspapers.A century and a half ago, it was an
English game,having been invented in England.But slowly it had spread all over the 
world.Today,cricket has a large audience-watching the game live in stadiums,on
television,etc.
