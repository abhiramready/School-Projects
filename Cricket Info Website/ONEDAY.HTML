Limited-over matches are also known as One Day Cricket.This was introduced in 
the English domestic season of1963, in response to demand for a shorter and more
dramatic form of cricket,limiting to one innings by each side and also the numbers
of overs (now-a-days,usually 50).The idea was taken up in the international arena
in 1971 during England's tour of Australia.The one-day form has since become
a crowd puller and audience-generator along the globe,hastened by success
of the inagural World Cup in1975.The abbrevation ODI stands for One Day
International.Innovations have inclided the introduction of colored clothing,
distinct tournaments,and day-night matches (where play extends into the night
under floodlights,togethere with frequent nail-biting finishes).As a result cricket has
many supporters today.
